# BRKRST-2935
Repo for Cisco Live US Presentation BRKRST-2935 session.

Software included: ERNA.py - full lab/POC code.

Network Programmability and Software Defined Networking (SDN) have changed the way network engineers look at infrastructure and operations. Conversations about configuring networks are increasingly focused on the new Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and less around the familiar Command Line Interface (CLI).

Many engineers have questions about how this can be applied to existing environments.

This session will showcase the use of the open REST API's available in

    APIC-EM
    Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI)
    Cisco UCS Director
    Spark
    Tropo

to dynamically provision secured remote access to Enterprise resources for a third party entity. The code will configure firewalls, routers, switches, and Data Center compute resources.

CLI Templates to be deployed to the DC and Remote router are included.
